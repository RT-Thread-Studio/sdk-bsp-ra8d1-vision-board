# Single Color Code Tracking Example
#
# This example shows off single color code tracking using the OpenMV Cam.
#
# A color code is a blob composed of two or more colors. The example below will
# only track colored objects which have both the colors below in them.

import sensor, image, time, math

# Color Tracking Thresholds (L Min, L Max, A Min, A Max, B Min, B Max)
# The below thresholds track in general red/green things. You may wish to tune them...
thresholds = [(30, 100, 15, 127, 15, 127), # generic_red_thresholds -> index is 0 so code == (1 << 0)
              (30, 100, -64, -8, -32, 32)] # generic_green_thresholds -> index is 1 so code == (1 << 1)
# Codes are or'ed together when "merge=True" for "find_blobs".

sensor.set_pixformat(sensor.GRAYSCALE)
sensor.set_framesize(sensor.QVGA)
sensor.skip_frames(time = 2000)

clock = time.clock()

# Only blobs that with more pixels than "pixel_threshold" and more area than "area_threshold" are
# returned by "find_blobs" below. Change "pixels_threshold" and "area_threshold" if you change the
# camera resolution. "merge=True" must be set to merge overlapping color blobs for color codes.
