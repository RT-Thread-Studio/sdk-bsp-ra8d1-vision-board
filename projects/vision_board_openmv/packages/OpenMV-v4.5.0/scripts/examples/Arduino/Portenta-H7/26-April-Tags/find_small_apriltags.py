# Find Small Apriltags
#
# This script shows off how to use blob tracking as a pre-filter to
# finding Apriltags in the image using blob tracking to find the
# area of where the tag is first and then calling find_apriltags
# on that blob.

# Note, this script works well assuming most parts of the image do not
# pass the thresholding test... otherwise, you don't get a distance
# benefit.
