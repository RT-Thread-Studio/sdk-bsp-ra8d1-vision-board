# Negative Example
#
# This example shows off negating the image. This is not a particularly
# useful method but it can come in handy once in a while.

import sensor, image, time

sensor.reset() # Initialize the camera sensor.
sensor.set_pixformat(sensor.GRAYSCALE) # or sensor.GRAYSCALE
sensor.set_framesize(sensor.QVGA) # or sensor.QQVGA (or others)
sensor.skip_frames(time = 2000) # Let new settings take affect.
clock = time.clock() # Tracks FPS.

while(True):
    clock.tick() # Track elapsed milliseconds between snapshots().
    img = sensor.snapshot().negate()

    print(clock.fps()) # Note: Your OpenMV Cam runs about half as fast while
    # connected to your computer. The FPS should increase once disconnected.
