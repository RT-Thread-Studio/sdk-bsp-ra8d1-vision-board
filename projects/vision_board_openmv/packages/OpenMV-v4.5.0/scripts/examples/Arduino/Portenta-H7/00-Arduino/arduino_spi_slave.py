# SPI with the Arduino as the master device and the OpenMV Cam as the slave.
#
# Please wire up your OpenMV Cam to your Arduino like this:
#
# OpenMV Cam Master Out Slave In (P0) - Arduino Uno MOSI (11)
# OpenMV Cam Master In Slave Out (P1) - Arduino Uno MISO (12)
# OpenMV Cam Serial Clock        (P2) - Arduino Uno SCK  (13)
# OpenMV Cam Slave Select        (P3) - Arduino Uno SS   (10)
# OpenMV Cam Ground                   - Arduino Ground

import pyb, ustruct, time

text = "Hello World!\n"
data = ustruct.pack("<bi%ds" % len(text), 85, len(text), text) # 85 is a sync char.
# Use "ustruct" to build data packets to send.
# "<" puts the data in the struct in little endian order.
# "b" puts a signed char in the data stream.
# "i" puts a signed integer in the data stream.
# "%ds" puts a string in the data stream. E.g. "13s" for "Hello World!\n" (13 chars).
# See https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html

# READ ME!!!
#
# Please understand that when your OpenMV Cam is not the SPI master it may miss responding to
# sending data as a SPI slave no matter if you call "spi.send()" in an interrupt callback or in the
# main loop below. Because of this you must absolutely design your communications protocol such
# that if the slave device (the OpenMV Cam) doesn't call "spi.send()" in time that garbage data
# read from the SPI peripheral by the master (the Arduino) is tossed. To accomplish this we use a
# sync character of 85 (binary 01010101) which the Arduino will look for as the first byte read.
# If it doesn't see this then it aborts the SPI transaction and will try again. Second, in order to
# clear out the SPI peripheral state we always send a multiple of four bytes and an extra four zero
# bytes to make sure that the SPI peripheral doesn't hold any stale data which could be 85. Note
# that the OpenMV Cam will miss the "spi.send()" window randomly because it has to service
# interrupts. Interrupts will happen a lot more while connected to your PC.

# The hardware SPI bus for your OpenMV Cam is always SPI bus 2.
# polarity = 0 -> clock is idle low.
# phase = 0 -> sample data on rising clock edge, output data on falling clock edge.
spi = pyb.SPI(2, pyb.SPI.SLAVE, polarity=0, phase=0)

# NSS callback.

        spi.send(data, timeout=1000)
    except OSError as err:
        pass # Don't care about errors - so pass.
        # Note that there are 3 possible errors. A timeout error, a general purpose error, or
        # a busy error. The error codes are 116, 5, 16 respectively for "err.arg[0]".

# Configure NSS/CS in IRQ mode to send data when requested by the master.
