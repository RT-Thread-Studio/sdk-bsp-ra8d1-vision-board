# Rotation Correction
#
# This example shows off how to use the rotation_corr() to both correct for
# perspective distortion and then to rotate the new corrected image in 3D
# space aftwards to handle movement.

#

#   (w-1, 0)

#
# Try setting the points below to the corners of a quadrilateral
# (in clock-wise order) in the field-of-view. You can get points
# on the image by clicking and dragging on the frame buffer and
# recording the values shown in the histogram widget.
