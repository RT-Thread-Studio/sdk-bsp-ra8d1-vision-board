# Lepton Get Object Temp Example
#
# This example shows off how to get an object's temperature using color tracking.

# By turning the AGC off and setting a max and min temperature range you can make the lepton into
# a great sensor for seeing objects of a particular temperature. That said, the FLIR lepton is a
# microblobometer and not a thermophile. So, it needs to re-calibrate itself often (which is called
# flat-field-correction - FFC). Additionally, microblobmeter devices require pprocessing support
# onboard to deal with the effects of temperature drift which is called radiometry support.

# FLIR Lepton Shutter Note: FLIR Leptons with radiometry and a shutter will pause the video often
# as they heatup to re-calibrate. This will happen less and less often as the sensor temperature
# stablizes. You can force the re-calibration to not happen if you need to via the lepton API.
# However, it is not recommended because the image will degrade overtime.

# If you are using a LEPTON other than the Lepton 3.5 this script may not work perfectly as other
# leptons don't have radiometry support or they don't activate their calibration process often
# enough to deal with temperature changes (FLIR 2.5).
