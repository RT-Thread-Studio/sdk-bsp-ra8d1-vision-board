# Image Transfer - As The Remote Device
#
# This script is made to pair with another OpenMV Cam running "image_transfer_raw_as_the_controller_device.py"
#
# This script shows off how to transfer the frame buffer from one OpenMV Cam to another.

# The RPC library above is installed on your OpenMV Cam and provides mutliple classes for
# allowing your OpenMV Cam to be controlled over CAN, I2C, SPI, UART, or LAN/WLAN.

# Uncomment the below line to setup your OpenMV Cam for control over CAN.
#
# * message_id - CAN message to use for data transport on the can bus (11-bit).
# * bit_rate - CAN bit rate.
# * sample_point - Tseg1/Tseg2 ratio. Typically 75%. (50.0, 62.5, 75.0, 87.5, etc.)
#
# NOTE: Master and slave message ids and can bit rates must match. Connect master can high to slave
#       can high and master can low to slave can lo. The can bus must be terminated with 120 ohms.
#
# interface = rpc.rpc_can_slave(message_id=0x7FF, bit_rate=1000000, sample_point=75.0)

# Uncomment the below line to setup your OpenMV Cam for control over I2C.
#
# * slave_addr - I2C address.
#
# NOTE: Master and slave addresses must match. Connect master scl to slave scl and master sda
#       to slave sda. You must use external pull ups. Finally, both devices must share a ground.
#
# interface = rpc.rpc_i2c_slave(slave_addr=0x12)

# Uncomment the below line to setup your OpenMV Cam for control over SPI.
#
# * cs_pin - Slave Select Pin.
# * clk_polarity - Idle clock level (0 or 1).
# * clk_phase - Sample data on the first (0) or second edge (1) of the clock.
#
# NOTE: Master and slave settings much match. Connect CS, SCLK, MOSI, MISO to CS, SCLK, MOSI, MISO.
#       Finally, both devices must share a common ground.
#
interface = rpc.rpc_spi_slave(cs_pin="P3", clk_polarity=1, clk_phase=0)

# Uncomment the below line to setup your OpenMV Cam for control over UART.
#
# * baudrate - Serial Baudrate.
#
# NOTE: Master and slave baud rates must match. Connect master tx to slave rx and master rx to
#       slave tx. Finally, both devices must share a common ground.
#
# interface = rpc.rpc_uart_slave(baudrate=7500000)
