# RTSP Video Server
#
# This example shows off how to stream video over RTSP with your OpenMV Cam.
#
# You can use a program like VLC to view the video stream by connecting to the
# OpenMV Cam's IP address.

# RTP MJPEG streaming works using JPEG images produced by the OV2640/OV5640 camera modules.
# Not all programs (e.g. VLC) implement the full JPEG standard for decoding any JPEG image
# in RTP packets. Images JPEG compressed by the OpenMV Cam internally may not display.

# FFPLAY will correctly handle JPEGs produced by OpenMV software.

sensor.reset()

sensor.set_pixformat(sensor.JPEG) # Only supported by the OV2640/OV5640.
sensor.set_framesize(sensor.UXGA)

# Turn off the frame buffer connection to the IDE from the OpenMV Cam side.
#
# This needs to be done when manually compressing jpeg images at higher quality
# so that the OpenMV Cam does not try to stream them to the IDE using a fall back
# mechanism if the JPEG image is too large to fit in the IDE JPEG frame buffer on the OpenMV Cam.

# `pathname` is the name of the stream resource the client wants. You can ignore this if it's not
# needed. Otherwise, you can use it to determine what image object to return. By default the path
# name will be "/".
#
# `session` is random number that will change when a new connection is established. You can use
# session with a dictionary to differentiate different accesses to the same file name.
