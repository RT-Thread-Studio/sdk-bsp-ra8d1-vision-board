# STM32Cube.AI enabled OpenMV firmware

This package provides the source code for compiling the OpenMV H7/H7+ firmware with STM32Cube.AI enabled.

It is a modified version of the official OpenMV firmware enabling STM32Cube.AI optimized neural networks.

The process for using STM32Cube.AI with OpenMV is described in the following figure.

Starting from a trained network model, such as a *.h5 Keras model* or *.tflite TensorFlow Lite model*, STM32Cube.AI will generate the optimized C code of the neural network. The generated files need to be copied into this project, then the firmware should be compiled using the GNU ARM Toolchain. Finally, the binary has to be flashed onto the OpenMV target using OpenMV IDE or STM32CubeProgrammer and the user will be able to program the board using microPython and call the neural network prediction function.
